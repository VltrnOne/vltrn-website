Connects an API to WordPress: Get API-data (JSON, XML, CSV...), show it with a Shortcode, a JCI Block or PHP.  Generate a template with the JCI Block

== Description ==

The simplest method to link WordPress with external APIs

JCI simplifies the task of retrieving data from a third-party REST API. The returned JSON-, XML, CSV, TXT-data can be neatly arranged and showcased on your WordPress site via a shortcode, a JCI Block or PHP. The plugin can generate a template for the data display.

### Main Plugin Features

* Low code usage: Save time and avoid coding using an API
* Insert an API-URL into Step 1: Data is loaded, and and displayed. Save it as API-Access-Set.
* Use the API-Access-Set in Step 2 to create a Shortcode
* Optional for maximum flexibility: Use the API-Access-Set n PHP code
* Insert an API-URL into the JCI Block: Data is loaded, and a template can be generated to display the data.
* Easy to start: Check Installation - Is your WordPress ready for JCI? Most probably!
* Basic Settings: Check SSL, Cacher, Gutenberg and Authentication
* ContactForm7 Integration: Populate CF7 forms with JSON data and forward CF7-submitted data to an API.
* Use the JCI cacher to avoid many API requests
* JCI-Block :  Use the simple JCI Block interface to get data! Query the API and check the response. Then utilize the simple template generator inside the JCI Block to use the data!
* Contact Form 7 Integration: Fill form and submit to API

= JSON Content Importer PRO =
Both the free and PRO JCI Plugins serve the same purpose: retrieving data, transforming it, and publishing the results.
However, while the free Plugin can only handle basic challenges, the PRO JCI Plugin offers nearly full control over WordPress, the database, and applications.
[Compare: Free vs. JCI PRO Plugin](https://json-content-importer.com/compare/)

PRO features:
* application building by creating a searchform and connect it to a JSON-API in the background: pass GET-Variables to use a dynamic JSON-Feed-URL ("talk to API / webservice")
* much better and more flexible templateengine: twig
* create and use Custom Post Types
* store Templates independent of pages
* more Shortcode-Parameters
* executing Shortcodes inside a template
* more features...

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Help! I need more information! =
[Check the JCI manual, please](https://doc.json-content-importer.com)

= Where to start?
Give it a try: The JCI plugin's block comes with a simple, easy-to-understand example. This lets you learn how JCI works without any risk.

= What does this plugin do? =
This plugin enables you to insert a WordPress shortcode or a Gutenberg Block within any page, post, or Custom Post Type (CPT). This facilitates the retrieval of data from an API, which you can then manipulate, such as converting it to HTML for display purposes.
Connecting an API to WordPress offers enhanced content management, extended functionality, personalization and scalability. It enables real-time data display, third-party service integration, and process automation, making your website dynamic and powerful.
The plugin parses almost any JSON-feed and allows you to display all data on your website: Import data from an API or Webservice to display it on your website.

= How can I make sure the plugin works? =
Select the 'JSON Content Importer' option from the Admin Menu. Upon doing so, you'll be presented with various tabs, one of which is labeled 'Check Installation.' Ensure all the tests conducted here are successfully passed for the optimal functioning of the plugin.
Then use the Shortcodes from Tab "Step 1: Get data" and if successful "Step 2: Use data". If that does not work, check Tab "Support".

= Where is this plugin from? =
This plugin is made in munich, bavaria, germany!
Famous for Oktoberfest, FC Bayern Munich, AllianzArena, TUM, BMW, Siemens, seas, mountains and much more...


### Basic structure of a JCI Shortcode (use the JCI Block to generate such a shortcode and a template):
= Shortcode =
'[jsoncontentimporter
* url="http://...json"
* numberofdisplayeditems="number: how many items of level 1 should be displayed? display all: leave empty or set -1"
* urlgettimeout="number: who many seconds for loading url till timeout?"
* basenode="starting point of datasets, the base-node in the JSON-Feed where the data is"
* oneofthesewordsmustbein="default empty, if not empty keywords spearated by ','. At least one of these keywords must be in the created text (here: text=code without html-tags)"
* oneofthesewordsmustbeindepth="default: 1, number: where in the JSON-tree oneofthesewordsmustbein must be?"
]
This is the template:
Any HTML-Code plus "basenode"-datafields wrapped in "{}"
{subloop:"basenode_subloop":"number of subloop-datasets to be displayed"}
Any HTML-Code plus "basenode_subloop"-datafields wrapped in "{}". If JSON-data is HTML add "html" flag like "{fieldname:html}"
{/subloop:"basenode_subloop"}
[/jsoncontentimporter]'

* templates like "{subloop-array:AAAA:10}{text}{subloop:AAAA.image:10}{id}{/subloop:AAAA.image}{/subloop-array:AAAA}" are possible:
one is the recursive usage of "subloop-array" and "subloop".
the other is "{subloop:AAAA.image:10}" where "AAAA.image" is the path to an object. This is fine for some JSON-data.

= Some special add-ons for datafields =
* "{street:purejsondata}": Default-display of a datafield is NOT HTML, but HTML-Tags are converted : use this to use really the pure data from the JSON-Feed
* "{street:html}": Default-display of a datafield is NOT HTML: "&lt;" etc. are converted to "&amp,lt;". Add "html" to display the HTML-Code as Code.
* "{street:htmlAndLinefeed2htmlLinefeed}": Same as "{street:html}" plus "\n"-Linefeeds are converted to HTML-Linebreak
* "{street:ifNotEmptyAddRight:,}": If datafield "street" is not empty, add "," right of datafield-value. allowed chars are: "a-zA-Z0-9,;_-:&lt;&gt;/ "
* "{street:html,ifNotEmptyAddRight:extratext}": you can combine "html" and "ifNotEmptyAdd..." like this
* "{street:purejsondata,ifNotEmptyAddLeftRight:LEFT##RIGHT##}": If datafield "street" is not empty, add text on the left and right
* "{street:ifNotEmptyAdd:,}": same as "ifNotEmptyAddRight"
* "{street:ifNotEmptyAddLeft:,}": If datafield "street" is not empty, add "," left of datafield-value. allowed chars are: "a-zA-Z0-9,;_-:&lt;&gt;/ "
* "{locationname:urlencode}": Insert the php-urlencoded value of the datafield "locationname". Needed when building URLs
